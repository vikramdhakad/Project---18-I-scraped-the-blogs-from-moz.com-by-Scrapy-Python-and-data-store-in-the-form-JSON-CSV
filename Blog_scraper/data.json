Sounds mighty familiar, no? We at SEOmoz, and most of the rest of the informed SEO world had been talking about this for the last few years; in particular since March of 2004 when the infamous \"sandbox\" first reared its ugly head. It's nice to get confirmation and feel the vindication of this transparency, but there's also a lesson to be learned - Google isn't perfect and they often look inward. The note that this problem wasn't addressed until the query \"Google Finance\" didnt' show \"Google Finance\" is strong evidence that Google is like many other companies. Things don't get fixed unless the folks internally feel the pain of the problem. Thus, next time you want to fight with the Google engineers about what you feel is inequitable treatment in the SERPs, the best way to do it might be to illustrate how the problem affects Google products."},

A neural net allows for an important leap in computing technology - learning. Learning computers are based around a neural net system and we can assume that Microsoft has done much the same thing with its ranking algorithm - causing this incredible leap forward in quality of ranking results. The question that remains is how the neural net is trained - obviously the corpus of data is the www's many sites and pages, but is there massive human input that helps to train the algorithm, or is it operating independently. My money's on the former, but there could well be implementations of both."},
